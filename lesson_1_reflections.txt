How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could easily find out what I have missed or done wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
 
    I would know how errors happend in a long round

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: you would be very aware of logical change in your code  and make a wise judment for
    your code in future.
    cons:you might forget to commit.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git might be designed for coding purpose, however google docs would be more documents oriented.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   typing "git log" to see history of repositories
   typing "git diff id1 id2" to see the changes made on gits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it can back my ass up.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to use git for completing my project.....
